# E2E - eye to eye relationship management system

Service for my own usage, monolith app with lots of features. Probably I'll split it to
microservices in the future, but definitely not now.

features:
 - advanced users and roles management
 - financial operations management, allows to analyze consumptions better
 - notes management
 - work time management
 - relationship score tracking
 - activity calendar
 - all services are synchronized and create nice ecosystem
