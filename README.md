# E2Eâ€”eye to eye

Service for my own usage, monolith app with lots of features. Probably I'll split it to
microservices in the future, but definitely not now.

features:
 - advanced users and roles management
 - financial operations management allows analyzing consumption better
 - currency scraper (myfin.by)
 - notes management
 - work time management
 - relationship score tracking
 - activity calendar
 - all services are synchronized and create a nice ecosystem
